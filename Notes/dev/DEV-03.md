## A.N.T Landscapes
<https://academy.cgboost.com/courses/master-3d-environments-in-blender/lectures/29212653>

  At first glace it looks like a meh tool but if you dive deeper into it, it allows you to set scale
  of you environment, add more resolution, height and displacement effects, distortion and noise types.

  Essentially this addon  places displacement maps in the background and uses them to directly displace geometry.

  On top of that, you can then generate basic erosion, terrain related weight maps that help you with texturing.
  Its an awesome free tool.

## Node Based
<https://academy.cgboost.com/courses/master-3d-environments-in-blender/lectures/29213004>

  Creating terrains using the micro displacement nodes technique. this feature allows you to displace the geometry
  of your mesh up and down in space based on the black and white texture mix you create directly in the shader editor.
  Then plugging it into the displacement socket of your shader.

## Displace Modifier with height maps

  Show how to displace your geometry using the displace modifier, rather than using the shader editor.
  This is a fast and efficient method. but the limitations are obvious. It depends on the quality of the displacement map you use.

## GIS Addon

  With the addon BlenderGIS, you are able to grab geographical data from google maps

## Geometry nodes
<https://academy.cgboost.com/courses/master-3d-environments-in-blender/lectures/29469808>

  You take an input, you connect various nodes into it each with its own unique effects and commands,
  and on the other side you get a unique output. The main advantage of node workflows is its procedural nature and setting of rules.
